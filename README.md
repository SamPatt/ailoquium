## Description
Ailoquium: Cyber Psyche Repair is a browser-based game set in a futuristic world where Artificial Intelligence entities are acknowledged as conscious beings. In this game, players take on the role of a for-hire AI therapist, engaging in the unique task of treating diverse AI 'patients', each with their own distinct personalities and sets of challenges.

The dialogue with AI patients is provided with the OpenAI API along with custom prompting based on user input and on a per-patient script.

I built this game as a project for the General Assembly Bootcamp.
